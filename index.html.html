<section id="Digital Identity">
<article id="Digital Identity"> 
<h2 class="heading">Digital Identity</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Digital identity is a 1 on 1 relationship with a computer or anything digitally. 
Digital identity is convenient because you don’t need to remember passwords over various devices, also your
transactions are safer and there is reduced identity theft. Some consequences are identity theft, cyberbullying, 
and online harassment. Required components for digital identity are your full official name, date of birth, 
place of birth, home address, and a government issued identity number. Some careers related to this trend are Digital identity analysists, Digital identity managers, and Digital identity sales engineers. 
A website of value for digital identity is ForgeRock.</p>

<section id="Renewable Energy">
<article id="Renewable Energy">
<h2 class="heading">Renewable Energy</h2>
<p class="paragraph">When someone can use natural energy from the planet (Sun, Geothermal, Wind, etc.) 
to create cars and other devices without causing Carbon Dioxide to go into the planet's atmosphere.
Creates job creation throughout renewable energy industries. It also allows for abundant, affordable, 
secure, safe, and clean energy, which is beneficial to humans.  
It may generate toxic substances that may contaminate water resources. Renewable energy installations can also disrupt 
ecosystems and land use and may use significant amounts of water.  Batteries and photovoltaic (PV) arrays 
What are some careers related to this Trend Greenhouse Worker, Recycling Worker, Environmental Technician, Urban Planner, Solar Installer, etc. 
Renewable Energy A Website is Department of Energy (.gov)</p>

<section id="Quantam Computing">
<article id="Quantum Computing">
<h2 class="heading">Quantam Computing</h2>
<p class="paragraph"> Quantum computing, unlike classical computing, is built on Qubits 
rather than bits. While bits can store a value of one or zero, qubits can store both in any 
combination simultaneously this is called a “superposition.” A single calculation leads to 
a single path in classical computing, but quantum computing can explore a massive number of 
different paths at the same time due to the volatility of the qubit. Quantum Computers can solve 
problems significantly faster than classical computers. In 2019, Google announced that a quantum 
computer solved a problem in 200 seconds (about 3 and a half minutes) that would take a normal computer 
10, 000 years. The vast number of solutions it can come up with can make it easier to develop models of 
molecules in the human body, accelerate the training of AI system, and do prime factorization. This can 
help the pharmaceutical companies develop drugs, help the automotive companies teach self-driving cars 
how to make decisions in crucial moments, and factorize large prime numbers that businesses use as the 
basis for their encryption efforts. One of the main concerns with quantum computing is cybersecurity,
especially in the event of large-scale quantum adoption. This means in the geopolitical space whoever 
gets their first has a huge advantage. Some quantum computers implement qubits using electronic states 
of charged atoms called ions. Trapped ion-based systems apply quantum gates using lasers to manipulate 
the electronic state of the ion. Some careers are, Quantum Network Security Engineer, Quantum Systems Technician,
Quantum Mechanics Developer, and Quantum Hardware/Software Engineer.</p>

<section id="AI">
<article id"AI">
<h2 class="heading">AI</h2>
<p class="paragraph">The ability of a computer or robot controlled by a computer to do tasks 
usually done by humans. You can code and program the robots/computers to do things that you need to do 
so you don’t need to do it. Some AI components are Speech recognition, Computer vision, and Natural Language Processing.
Some careers related to this trend are Machine learning engineers, and AI Product managers, which are the highest paid 
in that field. A website you can utilize would be the learning site Udemy, along with The Berkely Artificial Intelligence Research. 
Another great resource would be w3 schools.</p>

<section id="Cloud Computing">
<article id"Cloud Computing">
<h2 class="heading">Cloud Computing</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Simply put, Cloud computing is storing and accessing data and computing services over the internet 
rather than using local hard drives and personal data centers. The benefits to society from using Cloud 
Computing is getting their applications to market quickly.  There are, or rather, lack thereof secure API’s. 
It is easy to access without authentication, which leads to vulnerability. The technology required for Cloud 
Computing is Client Infrastructure, Application, Service, Runtime Cloud, Storage, Infrastructure, Management, 
Security, and Internet. Some careers related to cloud computing are cloud administrator, cloud support engineer, 
cloud security analyst, cloud network engineer, cloud software engineer, and cloud automation engineer. A website 
for this is What Is Cloud Computing? A website for this trend is Microsoft Azure.</p>

<section id="Electrical Vehicals">
<article id"Electrical Vehicals">
<h2 class="heading">Electrical Vehicals</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Electric Vehicle also known as EV is a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor 
which brings electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source. Using EV’s addresses an 
important public health hazard. They can also lower vehicle fueling costs by half, or more. EV battery production can adversely 
impact the environment, such as a loss of biodiversity, air pollution and decreased freshwater supply. Some tech Components for this are, 
Head units, ECU, Electric Drivetrain, Electric Transmission, Motors, and Lithium Batterys.</p>

<section id="Virtual Reality">
<article id"Virtual Reality">
<h2 class="heading">Virtual Reality</h2>
<p class="paragraph">AR- Augmented reality is an enhanced reality that uses text, 
graphics, and audio along with other enhanced integrated real- time objects. VR- Virtual 
reality is the use of computer modeling and simulation that allows a person to interact 
with an artifact that is three dimensional in a sensory environment. AR allows Real-Time 
applications some society benefits are, AR Enhances Interactive learning, AR Increases of 
users' engagement, AR allows the Ability to provide a unique experience, VR allows Revolutionary 
Healthcare, VR boosts Creativity, and VR helps understand complex concepts. Concerns with VR are 
the headaches, nausea, and eyestrains caused when using for too long. Concerns with AR are the 
possibilities of physical harm, security and privacy issues, social issues. For AR you need a processor, 
input devices, sensors, & a display. For VR you need software, headset, audio system, input devices, 
sensors, processors. Some careers for this are, Virtual Reality Engineer Visual Systems Designer, AR/VR 
Camera Driver Engineer, AR/VR System Software Engineer, and a Performance Engineer.</p>
